# Things to do:
1. Keep track of files being worked on and make process IDs from it
    1. To keep track of who is working on what file. So no two workers
       work on the same file.
2. Keep track of files with errors and save the file names in another file
    1. We need to check if these files are error files first by trying and assigning
       them to another worker. If it fales with different workers x amount of time then
       the file is the problem.
3.
